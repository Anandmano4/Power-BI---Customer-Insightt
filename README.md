# Power-BI---Customer-Insightt
# Customer Personality Data - Visualization & Storytelling (Power BI)

This project is part of my internship task (Day 2), where I explored customer behavior using Power BI and crafted a visual story based on the "Customer Personality Analysis" dataset.

## Dataset Source
- [Customer Personality Analysis â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis)

## Objective
To create meaningful visualizations that reveal customer insights and tell a compelling data-driven story.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Power BI

## Key Visualizations
1. **Bar Chart**: Total spending (on meat, wine, gold, etc.) by Education level.
2. **Pie Chart**: Distribution of Marital Status among customers.
3. **Scatter Plot**: Income vs Total Spend, color-coded by Education level.
4. **Column Chart**: Count of accepted campaigns per campaign type.

## Insights & Storytelling
- Graduates tend to have higher total spending compared to others.
- Majority of customers are married, which may influence marketing strategy.
- There's a positive correlation between income and total spending.
- Campaign 3 had the highest acceptance rate among all.
